# WordPress Custom Post Types Generator #

This is (well, will be) a simple PHP web app to generate code to register WordPress Custom Post Types. Coding these by hand is tedious.

## Features planned ##

* Web form to walk you through.
* Export beautiful PHP code.
* Export a serialized object of your created post type so that you can import it later.
* Editing of previously created post types, in case the API changes.

## Bootstrap ##

We're going to use Twitter's Bootstrap to make this, because it looks nice, and it'll be a good adventure.
